# Preface {.unnumbered}

This booklet writing project was carried out as part of a summer
internship at the University of Edinburgh, supported by the Erasmus+
programme during 2025. As a small group, we collaborated on a weekly
basis to improve the examples that we curated throughout the process.

This is a practical booklet created for data visualization examples in R
environment using specific libraries, mainly focusing on the built in
functions from the well known [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
library, and certain extensions of `ggplot2` library and some packages
for the big data implementation.

> The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device. (John Tukey)

## Motivation and Goal

This booklet was born out of a growing need to communicate complex data
in a clear and accessible way. As data grows in volume and complexity,
visual tools have become essential for uncovering insights that might
otherwise remain hidden. Motivated by a personal interest in data
visualization, this project also aims to fill the gaps left by existing
resources---many of which focus either too heavily on code or abstract
theory.

Our goal is to provide a guide that is technically sound yet simple and
intuitive, aimed at readers with a basic understanding of data. While
various tools exist for visualization, this booklet focuses primarily on
R programming, emphasizing its strengths in flexibility,
reproducibility, and statistical integration.

Specifically, various data visualization packages in R are underlined
and certain packages are examined for certain examples. While creating
some data visualization, our interest lies in the effective data
storytelling from visual to its interpretation.

> Words and pictures belong together. (Edward R. Tufte)

## Target Audience

This booklet is intended for students, early-stage researchers, and data enthusiasts who want to strengthen their understanding of data visualization using R. It assumes only a basic familiarity with data analysis and aims to present both core principles and practical examples in a clear and accessible way, making it useful for both beginners and those looking to refresh their skills.

## Initial Thoughts

Throughout the project, we encountered several challenges---both
technical and conceptual. Despite these challenges, we approached each
problem methodically---consulting documentation, testing alternative
solutions, and learning from examples and community discussions. All
these faced and resolved challenges are the part of learning process
while writing our examples.

-   One of the first difficulties was handling large and complex
    datasets efficiently within the R environment. Some of the packages
    required for big data visualization demanded careful memory
    management and unfamiliar workflows, especially when working with
    tools like SparkR and Arrow.

-   Another major challenge was choosing the right type of visualization
    for different kinds of data and ensuring that the graphics remained
    both accurate and interpretable. It often took multiple iterations
    to find the right balance between simplicity and completeness.

-   We also spent considerable time understanding the underlying
    structure of the data and preparing it for analysis. Missing values,
    inconsistent formats, and merging different data sources required a
    lot of manual adjustment and trial-and-error.

## Why?

On major motivation is to understand the importance of data
visualization of various size data sets and available toolkit with their
pros and cons. Additionally, even if there are other open source R-based
books, many of them generally just share the code in certain examples
without highlighting the underlying process to reach the final visual
image. Another driving force is to create a more comprehensive open
source booklet by touching not only on the data visuals in R in a
classical way but also giving certain aspects about the investigation of
big data, and added design perspective.

All the open source books available in the field and authors recent
experiences are the major source of the answer of this question.

## For Reproducibility

In order to create the graphs in this book, you'll need to install a
number of optional R packages. Most of these packages are hosted on the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). To install all of these CRAN
packages, run the following code in the RStudio console window.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Firs install if the specified package is not installed before by uncommenting below
# install.packages('ggplot2')

library(ggplot2)

```

To reproduce specific examples, you can rely on any given package the
first time it is needed in your code chunk, console or R file.
Generally, after getting all above mentioned packages, you should be
ready to reproduce all the examples we shared in this booklet.
