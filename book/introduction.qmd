# Introduction (before diving) {#sec-indexing}

In today's world, with the explosive growth of data, deriving valuable insights and presenting them in a meaningful way has become ever more
essential. Particularly, when working with big data, statistical analysis alone is often insufficient; supporting these analyses with
powerful visualizations should be regarded as key priority in data-driven decision making.

## Purpose of new writing (No Dataframes Here)

This booklet writing aims to explore how classic visualization techniques are applied to "small" to "moderate" datasets to the realm of big data. 
Our created examples aim to demonstrate that data visualization is not merely about creating graphs, but about generating meaningful insights. 

It explores which types of graphs are suitable for different data structures, how to
construct them using small to moderate datasets, and how these techniques applied when it comes to big data. Furthermore, the
interactive dashboards and visualizations we used in this booklet targets foster engagement with reader. By doing so, we aim to contribute
open-source materials and support R community. 

Main focuses and side benefits of diving into this booklet are:

- Improving practical skills while dealing with big data.
- Utilizing R tools such as Spark, Arrow, ggplot2, and tmap in order to create scalable and effective visual representations.
- Highlighting the differences between different types of data, and appyling proper visualizations for each.
- Safeguarding that visualizations are accessible and interpretable for both technical and general users.
- Promoting scientific transparency by designing reproducible analysis process.

In addition to the well-known cases of the data viz examples over small data sets, we intend to bridge the gap between big data and
data visualization, illustrating how technical tools in data science can be used for powerful representations.

## Overview of Datasets Used

**Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2020:** 

The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation is a relative measure of deprivation across 6,976
small areas (called data zones). If an area is identified as ‘deprived’, this can relate to people having a low income but it can also mean fewer
resources or opportunities. SIMD looks at the extent to which an area is deprived across seven domains: income, employment, education, health,
access to services, crime and housing. The dataset description was obtained from the Scottish Government's [Official SIMD
Documentation](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020/)

**Fringe Festival Data Set 2024:**
